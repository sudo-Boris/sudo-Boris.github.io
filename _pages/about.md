👨🏻‍💻 I have an **MEng degree in General Engineering** from Durham University. I specialised in Mechanical Engineering.

🔬 I have research experience in developing a **Deep Learning Model to do Computational Fluid Dynamics**.

📚 I am currently an **Internship-Researcher** at Durham Univeristy, continuing to scale my Deep-Learning Model.

👨🏻‍🔬 I will be joining **PwC** where I will continue to pursue my interest in applied AI.



## 📜 Research experience
I generated training data using Ansys Fluent Fluid simulations on my Universities supercomputer for rooms with different airflow characteristics. Eeach simulation took 5 hours.

I used novel techniques to lay the foundation for a generalisable AI to replicate the results of CFD in less that one second to less than 5% Mean Absolute Percentage Error.

I am contiung my work as an Internship research at Durham University. I plan to use SQL to create a scalable dataframe and apply techniques to down-sample the quatity of data whilst retaining important information.

Feel free to look at my dissertation paper [portfolio entry](https://engineermac.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Work
Currently I am working as a **Student Researcher** at Durham Univeris
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I worked on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## 📚 Education
MEng General Engineering 2024, Durham University.
