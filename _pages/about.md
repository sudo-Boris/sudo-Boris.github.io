# About Me 

👨🏻‍💻 I have an MEng degree in General Engineering from Durham University.

🔬 I have research experience in applied AI and I am particulary interested in the intersection of engineering and AI.

📚 I am currently an **Internship-Researcher** at Durham Univeristy, continuing to scale my Deep-Learning Model.


# Selected Experience

## 📜 Research experience
I trained a Deep Learning model

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Work
Currently I am working as a **Student Researcher** at the Reliable Multimodal AI Lab at the TU Darmstadt under the supervision of Prof. Marcus Rohrbach working on **Generative Video-Language Modelling**.
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I worked on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## 📚 Education
MEng General Engineering 2024, Durham University.
